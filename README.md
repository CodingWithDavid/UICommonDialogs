# Common UI Dialogs for Blazor

It is always good to reuse code and with Blazor's components model it is simple.  I have built a reuseable dialog built on top of the Blazored Modal.

## Why

I realized I used several of the same types of UI dialogs in my applications, Confirmation with OK/Cancel, confirmation with Yes/No, Warning confirmation and a single input type dialog.  So I figure why not create a UI component that I can reuse for these.  This is that projects.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/UICommonDialogs
   cd UICommonDialogs
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. Blazored Modal
2. Blazored Toast - used for visual feed back
3. Index Page with buttons to launch the different common dialog modals
4. Buttons component that handles the logic and UI for the Common dialogs
